Hi! I'm a final-year PhD candidate in the Mechanical Engineering department at UC Berkeley. I'm advised by Prof. Kosa Goucher-Lambert in the [Co-Design Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/), where I do research on sustainability and human-centered design processes, helping enable designers to apply sustainability principles in the early stages of design. I am affiliated with the [Berkeley Institute of Design](https://bid.berkeley.edu/) and am generously funded by [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). More broadly, I am interested in the intersection of design methods, environmental sustainability, and AI tools.

Previously, I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, where I worked on ocean acidification research with Dr. Carolina Bastidas.
